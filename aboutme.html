              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <h3>Uncomplicated, delicious recipes everyone can make and enjoy.</h3>
              <p>I work. I mean, I really work. I've got a pretty serious job. And I'm a wife, and a mum, and a friend, and a manager, and a mentor, and a peer, and an Aunty, and a daughter-in-law, and a sister-in-law. And all of these roles are important to me. Like everyone else, I struggle to find time to connect with the important people in my life, to have fun and rich experiences. Because my partner and I work so hard during the week, we don't socialise very much and the time we have with our kids after work is precious. It's busy, doing homework, sharing dinner and getting ready for the next day.  So we miss our friends.  Then, on weekends, the last thing we want to do is be away from the kids. Or spend 500 bucks on a meal out and babysitters. And neither do our friends that have kids. So we started having people over, so we could all catch up together: friends, kids, cats and dogs: the whole schmozzle. But I don't have time to tenderly pluck my freshly grown organic purple carrots from my gently turned composted bespoke veggie patch, whilst flambeing a line caught pike.  But I do love good food, as my mama was an amazing cook and my parents were great hosts.  And I do love to see my friends and have interesting conversations around a table.  Over the years, we've got very good at being really efficient and quick at pulling together a nice big, long lunch or a dinner party. Everything I make, anyone can make.  I break down my recipes into easy to understand instructions, and hopefully recreate some of that deliciousness, love, fun and conversations at their place.</p>
